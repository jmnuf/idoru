# Idoru
This is Idoru the lazy dragon, he'll search through the file system for files. The ability to search within your file system is what Idoru will aim to specialize at, for finding specific files with particular formatting and customizable formatting of search results.

Well that's the aim, if it's ever reached I don't know but at the very least it will be able to search through folders and attempt to open files and edit them as if it was notepad.

This app is being developed for ME in mind, so this will be built for windows first and my personal preference.

You can fork this repo if you want if you want something that works similar but looks different or looks similar and works different. I don't know when forking is done, but you can fork as you feel like and do better than me.
